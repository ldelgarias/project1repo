## My process

I used some code from a prior project assignment and from there I tested it on my local computer until I got the look that I needed. I googled a lot to find pieces that were not part of the prior project and integrated those on this project. I also had to learn a lot about github  -  building a repository, cloning in Atom, and using GitHub Desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML Responsive
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot through this process in terms of finding the elements I needed in order to get the layout as close as it was required and testing them as I went along.

### Useful resources

- Flexbox resource (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me on this and on a prior project to get the right flexbox elements. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
